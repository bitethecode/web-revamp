        I'm the main author of this unique journey.
        You may complain the story is boring, crazy, or even scary. Yet, I decided to write it only for myself, not to make others happy long time ago.
        I've been experimenting and stumbling every day to find out what I love thus I don't know where I go. Wish me luckðŸ˜‰
